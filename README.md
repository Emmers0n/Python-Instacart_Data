Instacart Grocery Basket Analysis
=================================

Objective
---------

As an analyst for Instacart, an online grocery store that operates through an app, the task is to perform an initial data and exploratory analysis to derive insights and suggest strategies for better segmentation based on the provided criteria.

Context
-------

Instacart stakeholders are interested in the variety of customers in their database along with their purchasing behaviors. They want to target different customers with applicable marketing campaigns to see whether they have an effect on the sale of their products. The stakeholders would like to be able to answer the following key questions:

### Key Questions

-   What are the busiest days of the week and hours of the day with the most orders?
-   Are there particular times of the day when people spend the most money?
-   What are the different price range groupings to help direct marketing efforts?
-   Which departments have the highest frequency of product orders?
-   What are the different types of customers in their system, and how do their ordering behaviors differ?
-   What different classifications does the demographic information suggest?

Stakeholders
------------

-   Vice President of Marketing: "We're always looking into improving our targeting for ad campaigns."
-   Senior Vice President of Sales: "We need to know what part of our offering has the lowest market share and why. Based on this input, we could improve this sector and boost sales."
-   Instacart Customer: "I want to receive ads, promotions, and recommendations that are relevant to the products I order regularly."

Data
